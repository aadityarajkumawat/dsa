What is a BST(Binary Search Tree)?

A tree in which each node follow a special rule,
which is the value of node on left has value less than
its root node and value of node on right should be
greater than or equal to its root.

Operations that we can perform?
* Insertion
* Searching
* Deletion (hardest of all)

Time Complexities
Average: O(log(N)) -> For all three (insertion, searching, deletion)
Worst: O(N) -> worst case is when BST has only one directional branch, almost like a linked list

Space Complexities
Average: O(1) -> Iterative approach, O(log(N)) -> Recursive approach
Worst: O(1) -> Iterative approach, O(log(N)) -> Recursive approach
