Given a BST and a target we find a value closest
to the given target

worst case binary tree has child nodes only in one direction

```Time Complexity```
Average: O(log(n))
Worst: O(n), when tree has child nodes only in one direction

```Space Complexity```
Recursively: O(log(n)), in worst case it will be O(n)
Iteratively: O(1)
