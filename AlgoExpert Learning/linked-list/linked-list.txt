Here, I m dealing with doubly linked lists,
and moving to singly linked lists won't be
much of a problem, after this.

```Searching```
O(n) time
O(1) space

```Removal methods```
O(1) time, the node to be remove is already provided
O(1) space

-> Remove All nodes by value
O(n) time
O(1) space

```Insertion at position(p)```
O(p) time
O(1) space
